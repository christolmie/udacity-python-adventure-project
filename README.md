## Introduction

This Adventure Game is part of the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree. This is my submission to that program and was supposed to be a simple introduction to refactoring code into functions.

I became absorbed by the whole process and ended up going down an object oriented path that I couldn't recover from.

It replicates the text based adventure games from the early nineties and is just a simple exercise to help you work though managing states, conditions and user interactions.

I chose to implement a state machine based on the following article:

https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/StateMachine.html

I found this approach to be much more satisfying than jumping from function to funciton as you move between rooms, and leaving a trail of unresolved function calls.

I also tried to separate story data from game control. I'm not convinced the way I have chosen to implement this is the best way, but it works, and the separation did help me in the development.


## Instructions

Download it, and play it. It's not very long, and not very polished but it is slightly amusing.

## Contributing

I need to submit my own code, so there really isn't any opportunity to contribute, but I would appreciate any suggestions or feedback on how I could make it better though.

I'm looking at state machines as a method to document and systemise processes. I'm also only at the beginning of the journey, so any help would be appreciated.
